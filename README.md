# historicquiz

This is a simple page where I practiced vue.js functions. This website is a quiz about history, and more specifically about Polish commanders. The quiz consists of 5 questions.

At the beginning, the button is displayed after clicking on it, the questions are displayed:

After selecting all the answers and pressing the button "Sprawdź Wyniki!" the page hides the questions and shows the number of points scored:

After pressing the button "Pokaż Odpowiedzi!" the page shows questions again. Well-marked answers are green, and wrong answers are red. In the short questions there was no answer or it was incorrect, the correct answers are highlighted:
